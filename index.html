            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Canan Dağdeviren (born May 4, 1985) is a Turkish academic, physicist, material scientist, and assistant
                professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she currently holds the LG Career
                Development Professorship in Media Arts and Sciences. Dagdeviren is the first Turkish scientist in the
                history of the Harvard Society to become a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard
                University. As a faculty member, she directs her own Conformable Decoders research group at the MIT
                Media Lab.[1] The group works at the intersection of materials science, engineering and biomedical
                engineering. They create mechanically adaptive electromechanical systems that can intimately integrate
                with the target object of interest for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting, among other
                applications.[1] Dagdeviren believes that vital information from nature and the human body is "coded" in
                various forms of physical patterns. Her research focuses on the creation of conformable decoders that
                can "decode" these patterns into beneficial signals and/or energy.</p>

            <h2>Education & Academic Career</h2>
            <p>Canan Dagdeviren studied physics engineering at the Hacettepe University in Ankara, graduating in 2007.
                She obtained a Master of Science degree from Sabancı University in Istanbul, and won a Fulbright
                scholarship for study in the United States. With this scholarship, she chose to conduct research in
                materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where she focused
                on exploring patterning techniques and creating piezoelectric biomedical systems. Here, one of the
                projects that she developed was a conformable, piezoelectric, energy harvester that converts mechanical
                energy from internal organ movements into electric energy to power medical devices. It is soft and
                flexible and conforms to the heart as well as other soft tissues. This technology could extend the
                battery life of implanted electronics or eliminate the need for battery replacement, sparing patients
                from repeated operations and the risk of surgical complications. In August 2014 she received her PhD
                degree. Her advisor was John A. Rogers, and the title of her PhD thesis was Ferroelectric/Piezoelectric
                Materials Flexible/Stretchable/Wearable/Implantable Sensors, Actuators, Mechanical Energy Harvesters,
                Transducers, Microfabrication.Dagdeviren then went to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to become a Junior
                Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University—the first Turkish scientist in the history of the
                Harvard Society to do so—as well as a postdoctoral research associate at MIT's Koch Institute for
                Integrative Cancer Research. Her postdoctoral advisor was MIT Institute Professor Robert S.
                Langer.Currently, Dagdeviren is an assistant professor at MIT. She teaches a course on conformable
                devices every semester, and also serves as a freshman advisor.Recently, she was invited to present to
                the World.Minds community at the annual invitation-only symposium in Zurich, Switzerland. Her most
                recent research and achievements are summarized in her World.Minds talk</p>

            <h2>Project & Publications</h2>

            <h3>YellowBox</h3>
            <p>The YellowBox is a cleanroom used by Conformable Decoders at the MIT Media Lab, which Dagdeviren designed
                and constructed from the ground up in 2017. When she was a PhD student, she promised herself that if she
                ever had the opportunity to build her own space, it would be physically transparent so that anyone
                passing by would have the ability to observe, take notes, and learn from her without needing any special
                permissions. This inclusivity is part of what makes YellowBox such a unique scientific environment.
                Another unique aspect of YellowBox is that it is organized using 5S Methodology. 5S is a system which
                uses five guiding practices to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness: Sort, Set in
                Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain. Essentially, 5S is an organizational methodology that uses
                visual labels—color-coded based on functionality—to organize spaces and increase safety, identifying
                potential hazards and procedural information. As a result of this highly organized and efficient system,
                YellowBox achieved a Green Labs certification by Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) in 2017—the first
                research lab at the MIT Media Lab to receive this designation since its founding in 1985. Recently,
                Dagdeviren published an article featured in Advanced Intelligent Systems describing her group's
                experience with greater efficiency, as a result of the 5S Methodology principles</p>

            <h3>Conformal Piezoelectric Mechanical Energy Harvesters (PZT MEH)</h3>
            <p>In 2014, Dagdeviren and her team developed conformal piezoelectric mechanical energy harvesters, which
                have been described as "mechanically invisible human dynamos." This project seeks to develop conformal
                piezoelectric patches integrated into personal garments to extract energy from body movements such as
                the motion of arms, fingers, and legs. In the future, this work could improve quality life for people
                and potentially provide environmentally friendly power. Since these energy harvesters are powered by
                human motion instead of battery power, the need for replacements and high risk/high cost surgical
                procedures to change depleted batteries could be eliminated.</p>

            <h3>Flexible Piezoelectric Devices for Gastrointestinal Motility Sensing (PZT GI-S)</h3>
            <p>In 2017, the PZT GI-S project (essentially "a Fitbit for the stomach.") was published. Dagdeviren and
                fellow collaborators designed an ingestible, flexible piezoelectric device that senses mechanical
                deformation within the gastric cavity. They demonstrated the capabilities of the sensor in both in vitro
                and ex vivo simulated gastric models, quantified its key behaviors in the gastrointestinal tract using
                computational modelling, and validated its functionality in awake and ambulating swine. The
                proof-of-concept device may lead to the development of ingestible piezoelectric devices that might
                safely sense mechanical variations and harvest mechanical energy inside the gastrointestinal tract for
                the diagnosis and treatment of motility disorders, as well as for monitoring ingestion in bariatric
                applications</p>

            <h3>Miniaturized Neural System For Chronic, Local Intracerebral Drug Delivery (MiNDS)</h3>
            <p>In 2018, Dagdeviren and her team developed an implantable, remotely controllable, miniaturized neural
                drug delivery system permitting dynamic adjustment of therapy with pinpoint spatial accuracy. Recent
                advances in medications for neurodegenerative disorders are expanding opportunities for improving the
                debilitating symptoms suffered by patients. Existing pharmacologic treatments, however, often rely on
                systemic drug administration, which result in broad drug distribution and consequent increased risk for
                toxicity. Given that many key neural circuitries have sub–cubic millimeter volumes and cell-specific
                characteristics, small-volume drug administration into affected brain areas with minimal diffusion and
                leakage is essential. Dagdeviren and her team demonstrates that this device can chemically modulate
                local neuronal activity in small-animal (rodent) and large-animal (nonhuman primate) models, while
                simultaneously allowing the recording of neural activity to enable feedback control</p>

            <h3>Electronic Textile Conformable Suit (E-TeCS)</h3>
            <p>In 2020, Dagdeviren and her team created a tailored, electronic textile conformable suit (E-TeCS) to
                perform large-scale, multi-modal physiological (temperature, heart rate, and respiration) sensing in
                vivo.[18] The rapid advancement of electronic devices and fabrication technologies has further promoted
                the field of wearables and smart textiles. However, most of the current efforts in textile electronics
                focus on a single modality and cover a small area. E-TeCS introduces a new platform of modular,
                conformable (i.e., flexible and stretchable) distributed sensor networks that can be embedded into
                digitally-knit textiles. This platform can be customized for various forms, sizes and functions using
                standard, accessible and high-throughput textile manufacturing and garment patterning techniques.</p>

            <h3>Conformable Facial Code Extrapolation Sensor (cFaCES)</h3>
            <p>In 2020, Dagdeviren announced the design and pilot testing of an integrated system for decoding facial
                strains and for predicting facial kinematics, called cFaCES. The system consists of mass-manufacturable,
                conformable piezoelectric thin films for strain mapping; multiphysics modelling for analysing the
                nonlinear mechanical interactions between the conformable device and the epidermis; and
                three-dimensional digital image correlation for reconstructing soft-tissue surfaces under dynamic
                deformations as well as for informing device design and placement. In healthy individuals and in
                patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), it is shown that the piezoelectric thin films,
                coupled with algorithms for the real-time detection and classification of distinct skin-deformation
                signatures, enable the reliable decoding of facial movements</p>

            <h2>Awards & Honors</h2>
            <p>In 2014, Dagdeviren became the first Turkish scientist to be elected as a Junior Fellow of Harvard.</p>

            <p> In 2015, MIT Technology Review named her among the "Top 35 Innovators Under 35" (inventor category), and
                Forbes magazine selected her as one of the "Top 30 Under 30 in Science." The following year she received
                many honors, including being named a Gifted Citizen by Ciudad de las Ideas of Puebla, Mexico, and the
                Spotlight Health Scholar by Aspen Institute. She placed first in the Medical Innovation Category of Ten
                Outstanding Young Persons of the World (TOYP) by Junior Chamber International (JCI), and received the
                2017 Innovation and Technology Delegate of the American Academy of Achievement Award. Dagdeviren was
                also awarded the Science and Sci Life Prize for Young Scientists in Translational Medicine Category by
                Science/AAAS and SciLifeLab, and attended the Nobel Prize Ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>

            <p>Since beginning her current position at the MIT Media Lab, Dagdeviren and her students published a paper
                "Towards personalized medicine: the evolution of imperceptible healthcare technologies," published in
                the November 2018 issue of Foresight, a journal of future studies, strategic thinking, and policy. The
                paper was selected by the journal's editorial board as an Outstanding Paper for the 2019 Emerald
                Literati Awards.</p>

            <p> In 2019, Dagdeviren was awarded the Kadir Has University Promising Scientist Award, and recognized in
                Fortune Turkey's "40 Under 40."She was also named as one of the United States's "87 brightest young
                engineers" by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and took part in the NAE's 25th annual US
                Frontiers
                of Engineering (USFOE) Symposium.</p>

            <p> In April 2021, Dagdeviren was honored with two awards: the 2021 National Science Foundation's Faculty
                Early
                Career Development Program (CAREER) award, and the 3M Non-Tenured Faculty award. The CAREER award will
                support Dagdeviren's research on conformable piezoelectrics for soft tissue imaging. The 3M award
                recognizes
                outstanding new faculty who were nominated by 3M researchers and selected based on their research,
                experience and academic leadership. Dagdeviren noted that the combination of these two awards is
                significant, because they will allow her to "make substantial scientific and leadership contributions to
                the
                emerging field of widely deployed biosensing tools, and to achieve a broader understanding of soft
                tissue in
                a collective and systemic way for improved human health."</p>
