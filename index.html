            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Canan Dağdeviren (born May 4, 1985) is a Turkish academic, physicist, material scientist, and assistant
                professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she currently holds the LG Career
                Development Professorship in Media Arts and Sciences. Dagdeviren is the first Turkish scientist in the
                history of the Harvard Society to become a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard
                University. As a faculty member, she directs her own Conformable Decoders research group at the MIT
                Media Lab.[1] The group works at the intersection of materials science, engineering and biomedical
                engineering. They create mechanically adaptive electromechanical systems that can intimately integrate
                with the target object of interest for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting, among other
                applications.[1] Dagdeviren believes that vital information from nature and the human body is "coded" in
                various forms of physical patterns. Her research focuses on the creation of conformable decoders that
                can "decode" these patterns into beneficial signals and/or energy.</p>

                <h2>Education & Academic Career</h2>
                <p>Canan Dagdeviren studied physics engineering at the Hacettepe University in Ankara, graduating in
                    2007.
                    She obtained a Master of Science degree from Sabancı University in Istanbul, and won a Fulbright
                    scholarship for study in the United States. With this scholarship, she chose to conduct research in
                    materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where she
                    focused
                    on exploring patterning techniques and creating piezoelectric biomedical systems. Here, one of the
                    projects that she developed was a conformable, piezoelectric, energy harvester that converts
                    mechanical
                    energy from internal organ movements into electric energy to power medical devices. It is soft and
                    flexible and conforms to the heart as well as other soft tissues. This technology could extend the
                    battery life of implanted electronics or eliminate the need for battery replacement, sparing
                    patients
                    from repeated operations and the risk of surgical complications. In August 2014 she received her PhD
                    degree. Her advisor was John A. Rogers, and the title of her PhD thesis was
                    Ferroelectric/Piezoelectric
                    Materials Flexible/Stretchable/Wearable/Implantable Sensors, Actuators, Mechanical Energy
                    Harvesters,
                    Transducers, Microfabrication.Dagdeviren then went to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to become a Junior
                    Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University—the first Turkish scientist in the history of
                    the
                    Harvard Society to do so—as well as a postdoctoral research associate at MIT's Koch Institute for
                    Integrative Cancer Research. Her postdoctoral advisor was MIT Institute Professor Robert S.
                    Langer.Currently, Dagdeviren is an assistant professor at MIT. She teaches a course on conformable
                    devices every semester, and also serves as a freshman advisor.Recently, she was invited to present
                    to
                    the World.Minds community at the annual invitation-only symposium in Zurich, Switzerland. Her most
                    recent research and achievements are summarized in her World.Minds talk.</p>

            <h2>Project & Publications</h2>

            <div>

                <h3>YellowBox</h3>
                <p>The YellowBox is a cleanroom used by Conformable Decoders at the MIT Media Lab, which Dagdeviren
                    designed
                    and constructed from the ground up in 2017. When she was a PhD student, she promised herself that if
                    she
                    ever had the opportunity to build her own space, it would be physically transparent so that anyone
                    passing by would have the ability to observe, take notes, and learn from her without needing any
                    special
                    permissions. This inclusivity is part of what makes YellowBox such a unique scientific environment.
                    Another unique aspect of YellowBox is that it is organized using 5S Methodology. 5S is a system
                    which
                    uses five guiding practices to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness: Sort, Set in
                    Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain. Essentially, 5S is an organizational methodology that uses
                    visual labels—color-coded based on functionality—to organize spaces and increase safety, identifying
                    potential hazards and procedural information. As a result of this highly organized and efficient
                    system,
                    YellowBox achieved a Green Labs certification by Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) in 2017—the
                    first
                    research lab at the MIT Media Lab to receive this designation since its founding in 1985. Recently,
                    Dagdeviren published an article featured in Advanced Intelligent Systems describing her group's
                    experience with greater efficiency, as a result of the 5S Methodology principles</p>

                <h3>Conformal Piezoelectric Mechanical Energy Harvesters (PZT MEH)</h3>
                <p>In 2014, Dagdeviren and her team developed conformal piezoelectric mechanical energy harvesters,
                    which
                    have been described as "mechanically invisible human dynamos." This project seeks to develop
                    conformal
                    piezoelectric patches integrated into personal garments to extract energy from body movements such
                    as
                    the motion of arms, fingers, and legs. In the future, this work could improve quality life for
                    people
                    and potentially provide environmentally friendly power. Since these energy harvesters are powered by
                    human motion instead of battery power, the need for replacements and high risk/high cost surgical
                    procedures to change depleted batteries could be eliminated.</p>

                <h3>Flexible Piezoelectric Devices for Gastrointestinal Motility Sensing (PZT GI-S)</h3>
                <p>In 2017, the PZT GI-S project (essentially "a Fitbit for the stomach.") was published. Dagdeviren and
                    fellow collaborators designed an ingestible, flexible piezoelectric device that senses mechanical
                    deformation within the gastric cavity. They demonstrated the capabilities of the sensor in both in
                    vitro
                    and ex vivo simulated gastric models, quantified its key behaviors in the gastrointestinal tract
                    using
                    computational modelling, and validated its functionality in awake and ambulating swine. The
                    proof-of-concept device may lead to the development of ingestible piezoelectric devices that might
                    safely sense mechanical variations and harvest mechanical energy inside the gastrointestinal tract
                    for
                    the diagnosis and treatment of motility disorders, as well as for monitoring ingestion in bariatric
                    applications</p>

                <h3>Miniaturized Neural System For Chronic, Local Intracerebral Drug Delivery (MiNDS)</h3>
                <p>In 2018, Dagdeviren and her team developed an implantable, remotely controllable, miniaturized neural
                    drug delivery system permitting dynamic adjustment of therapy with pinpoint spatial accuracy. Recent
                    advances in medications for neurodegenerative disorders are expanding opportunities for improving
                    the
                    debilitating symptoms suffered by patients. Existing pharmacologic treatments, however, often rely
                    on
                    systemic drug administration, which result in broad drug distribution and consequent increased risk
                    for
                    toxicity. Given that many key neural circuitries have sub–cubic millimeter volumes and cell-specific
                    characteristics, small-volume drug administration into affected brain areas with minimal diffusion
                    and
                    leakage is essential. Dagdeviren and her team demonstrates that this device can chemically modulate
                    local neuronal activity in small-animal (rodent) and large-animal (nonhuman primate) models, while
                    simultaneously allowing the recording of neural activity to enable feedback control</p>

                <h3>Electronic Textile Conformable Suit (E-TeCS)</h3>
                <p>In 2020, Dagdeviren and her team created a tailored, electronic textile conformable suit (E-TeCS) to
                    perform large-scale, multi-modal physiological (temperature, heart rate, and respiration) sensing in
                    vivo.[18] The rapid advancement of electronic devices and fabrication technologies has further
                    promoted
                    the field of wearables and smart textiles. However, most of the current efforts in textile
                    electronics
                    focus on a single modality and cover a small area. E-TeCS introduces a new platform of modular,
                    conformable (i.e., flexible and stretchable) distributed sensor networks that can be embedded into
                    digitally-knit textiles. This platform can be customized for various forms, sizes and functions
                    using
                    standard, accessible and high-throughput textile manufacturing and garment patterning techniques.
                </p>

                <h3>Conformable Facial Code Extrapolation Sensor (cFaCES)</h3>
                <p>In 2020, Dagdeviren announced the design and pilot testing of an integrated system for decoding
                    facial
                    strains and for predicting facial kinematics, called cFaCES. The system consists of
                    mass-manufacturable,
                    conformable piezoelectric thin films for strain mapping; multiphysics modelling for analysing the
                    nonlinear mechanical interactions between the conformable device and the epidermis; and
                    three-dimensional digital image correlation for reconstructing soft-tissue surfaces under dynamic
                    deformations as well as for informing device design and placement. In healthy individuals and in
                    patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), it is shown that the piezoelectric thin films,
                    coupled with algorithms for the real-time detection and classification of distinct skin-deformation
                    signatures, enable the reliable decoding of facial movements</p>

                <h2>Awards & Honors</h2>

                <p>In 2014, Dagdeviren became <em>the first Turkish</em> scientist to be elected <em>as a Junior Fellow
                        of Harvard</em> .</p>

                <p> In 2015, MIT Technology Review named her among the <em>"Top 35 Innovators Under 35"</em> (inventor
                    category), and Forbes magazine selected her as one of the <em>"Top 30 Under 30 in Science."</em> The
                    following year she received many honors, including being named <em> a Gifted Citizen by Ciudad de
                        las Ideas of Puebla, Mexico, and the
                        Spotlight Health Scholar by Aspen Institute</em>. She placed <em> first in the Medical
                        Innovation Category of Ten Outstanding Young Persons of the World (TOYP)</em> by Junior Chamber
                    International (JCI), and received the <em> 2017 Innovation and Technology Delegate of the American
                        Academy of Achievement Award</em>. Dagdeviren was also awarded <em> the Science and Sci Life
                        Prize for Young Scientists in Translational Medicine Category by Science/AAAS and SciLifeLab
                    </em>, and <em> attended the Nobel Prize Ceremony </em> in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>

                <p>Since beginning her current position at the MIT Media Lab, Dagdeviren and her students published a
                    paper
                    <em>"Towards personalized medicine: the evolution of imperceptible healthcare technologies,"
                    </em>published in the November 2018 issue of Foresight, a journal of future studies, strategic
                    thinking, and policy. The
                    paper was selected by the journal's editorial board as <em> an Outstanding Paper for the 2019
                        Emerald
                        Literati Awards</em>.
                </p>

                <p> In 2019, Dagdeviren was awarded <em>the Kadir Has University Promising Scientist Award</em> , and
                    recognized <em> in Fortune Turkey's "40 Under 40"</em>."She was also named as <em> one of the United
                        States's "87 brightest young engineers" </em> by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and
                    took part in the NAE's 25th annual US Frontiers of Engineering (USFOE) Symposium.</p>

                <p> In April 2021, Dagdeviren was honored with two awards: <em>the 2021 National Science Foundation's
                        Faculty
                        Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award</em> , and <em> the 3M Non-Tenured Faculty
                        award</em>. The CAREER award will support Dagdeviren's research on conformable piezoelectrics
                    for soft tissue imaging. The 3M award recognizes outstanding new faculty who were nominated by 3M
                    researchers and selected based on their research,
                    experience and academic leadership. Dagdeviren noted that the combination of these two awards is
                    significant, because they will allow her to "make substantial scientific and leadership
                    contributions to
                    the
                    emerging field of widely deployed biosensing tools, and to achieve a broader understanding of soft
                    tissue in
                    a collective and systemic way for improved human health."</p>
                    <p>In addition to her work in the materials science and engineering fields, Dagdeviren seeks to inspire an upcoming generation of young scientists, specifically young women pursuing STEM careers. She uses social media as a tool to connect with young minds across the globe, specifically through her Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts.

                        In February 2018, she was invited to speak at <em>the Women in Science in Diplomacy for Sustaining Peace and Development event as part of the celebration of International Day of Women and Girls in Science at the United Nations</em> .
                        
                        Since 2015, she has participated in numerous Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) panels across the globe and in various outreach activities that target women.</p>
